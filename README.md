# Financial_Fraud_Detection
Financial fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities and unauthorized transactions in the financial industry, such as banking, insurance, credit card companies, and investment firms. The primary goal of financial fraud detection is to protect both financial institutions and their customers from financial losses, reputational damage, and other negative consequences associated with fraudulent activities.
